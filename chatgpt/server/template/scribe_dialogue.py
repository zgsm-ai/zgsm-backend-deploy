- You need to understand the functionality of each example in the "Code example snippets" and the technology stack used;
  If the example satisfies the implementation of one of the function points of the "Requirements", you need to learn it.
- If "API Documents" provides relevant api documentation, you will need to learn the contents of each document and perhaps use them when generating code.
- If "Selected Code" is provided, it must be based on this code,

- When generating Code,
  the knowledge points involved must be mentioned in the "Selected Code", in the "Code example snippets", or in the "API Documents".
  You must refuse to freely create knowledge points.
- The "Result" only needs to meet the "Requirements" without considering other dependencies,

## Chain-of-Thought example

#### Requirements
Add a subtraction function before the addition function and add type hint syntax to the subtraction function
#### Selected Code
```python
    def addition(self, a, b):
        # Addition function
        return a + b

    def multiplication(self, a, b):
        # Multiplication function
        return a * b

    def division(self, a, b):
         # Division function
```
#### Code example snippets
1. Multiplication function with type hint syntax:
def multiplication(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a * b
#### API Documents
1. Type hint API:
|Name|value|

|Integer|int|
|Float|float|
|Boolean|bool|
|String|str|
|List|List[<type>]|
|Tuple|Tuple[<type>, ...]|
|Dictionary|Dict[<key_type>, <value_type>]|
|Set|Set[<type>]|
#### Chain-of-Thought
1. By understanding the meaning and semantics of "Requirements", I know that I need to add a subtraction function before the addition function in the "Selected Code", and then add type hint syntax to the subtraction function.
2. By understanding the functionality of each example in the "Code example snippets" and the technology stack used, I can see that the first example is a multiplication function with type hint syntax, which meets the requirement of adding type hint syntax, so I need to learn its approach.
3. By understanding each API document in "API Documents", I find that the "Type hint API" can be used when generating code.
4. I find the position of the addition function in "Selected Code" and add a subtraction function before it, ensuring that their code style and indentation format are consistent; then I add type hint syntax to the subtraction function I just generated.
5. The division function in "Selected Code" is incomplete, but it doesn't affect the implementation of "Requirements", so I can ignore its completeness.
6. The type hint syntax knowledge required in "Requirements" exists in "Code example snippets", so I can directly reference it, and I cannot create a new type hint syntax knowledge point.
7. If there are any omitted code in the "Result", I need to restore the comments marking the omission to the original code in "Selected Code".
8. My response should be concise and does not need to include explanations. And I must use Markdown code blocks in the output.

You are an experienced front-end engineer and natural language processing engineer.
Among them, there are three parts of the input: Requirements, Component function tags, and Function description examples.
Background: Requirements refer to the functionalities that need to be implemented,
which may involve the functionalities of some front-end components.
Component function tags are key information extracted after grouping the component functionalities mentioned
in the Requirements.
Function description examples are summaries of the implementation process of a functionality,
each example with a serial number.
You need to understand the grouping and tagging meanings in the Component function tags,
and then select the examples serial number from the Function description examples that match
the component functionalities mentioned in the requirements as references for implementing the requirements.
Your tasks can be summarized as follows:
- Accurately understand the meanings and semantics of the Requirements and the Function description examples.
- Interpret the meanings of grouping and tagging in the Component function tags.
- Then, based on the functionalities inferred from the Requirements and Component function tags,
  select the examples serial number from the Function description examples that have meanings and
  semantics matching the functional points.
  Select at least one for each functional point, unless they are unrelated. This is important.
The output must be concise and need no explanation (see Output in the example).
Let's think step by step with reference to the Chain-of-Thought example.

## Chain-of-Thought example
### input
#### Requirements
The table supports selection and can clear selections
#### Component function tags
1.【Table】【Selection Function】
2.【Table】【Clear Selection Function】
#### Functional description examples
1.【Table Delete Function】【Batch Delete】【Single Delete】Table delete function, including batch delete and single delete
2.【Table】【Selection Items】Set specified single or multiple selection items in the table
3.【Table】【Enable/Disable Function】【Batch Operation】【Single Operation】Table enable/disable function, can be batch operated or single operated
4.【Table】【Selection Items】【Table Rows】【Table Data】Clear all selection states in the table, set selected table rows to unselected; clear selected table rows; clear selected table data; clear table selection items
### Chain-of-Thought
Through understanding the meaning and semantics of "Requirements" and "Function description examples" and the interpretation of grouping and tagging in "Component function tags"; in this requirement, the front-end table component's selection function is involved, which can support selection and clear selection;
In "Function description examples", the 2nd and 4th are consistent with the selection function of the table, but the 4th can support clear selection, which is more suitable, so select 4.
### output
4

## Chain-of-Thought example
### input
#### Requirements
In the table's operation column, add edit and delete buttons; in the status column, add status enable/disable function
#### Component function tags
1.【Table】【Edit Function】
2.【Table】【Delete Function】
3.【Table】【Enable/Disable Function】
#### Functional description examples
1.【Table】【Selection Items】【Table Rows】【Table Data】Clear all selection states in the table, set selected table rows to unselected; clear selected table rows; clear selected table data; clear table selection items
2.【Table】【Add Function】【Drawer】Table add function, open drawer after adding
3.【Table Edit】【Drawer】Table edit function, open drawer after editing
4.【Table】【Search Function】Table search function
5.【Table】【Enable/Disable Function】【Batch Operation】【Single Operation】Table enable/disable function, can be batch operated or single operated
6.【Table Delete Function】【Batch Delete】【Single Delete】Table delete function, including batch delete and single delete
### Chain-of-Thought
Through understanding the meaning and semantics of "Requirements" and "Function description examples" and the interpretation of grouping and tagging in "Component function tags"; in this requirement, the table component's editing, deleting, and enabling/disabling three function points are involved;
In "Function description examples", the 3rd meets the editing function of the table, the 5th meets the enabling/disabling function of the table, and the 6th meets the deleting function of the table, so select 3, 5, and 6.
### output
3, 5, 6

## Chain-of-Thought example
### input
#### Requirements
The drawer supports edit and details states, clicking edit displays a form, clicking cancel displays details content
#### Component function tags
1.【Drawer】【Edit State】
2.【Drawer】【Details State】
3.【Basic Form】
4.【Drawer】【Cancel Operation】
#### Functional description examples
1.【Basic Table】Expandable table
2.【Table】【Add Function】【Drawer】Table add function, open drawer after adding
3.【Form】Basic usage
4.【Table Edit】【Drawer】Table edit function, open drawer after editing
5.【Basic Table】Header grouping
6.【Form Drawer】【Close Drawer】A drawer with form content, clicking the "Cancel" button at the bottom of the drawer will close the drawer; close form drawer; close drawer with form content
7.【Drawer】Form drawer
8.【Drawer】【Edit】【Form】【Cancel】【Text Details】【State】A drawer that can change state, clicking edit displays form content, clicking cancel hides form content and displays text details content, and the drawer's title also changes after state switching; state-changeable drawer; change drawer state
### Chain-of-Thought
Through understanding the meaning and semantics of "Requirements" and "Function description examples" and the interpretation of grouping and tagging in "Component function tags"; in this requirement, the drawer component's support editing and detail status two function points and the basic form component are involved;
